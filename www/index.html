				<p>
					On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea. <br>
					Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. <br>
					It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf. <br>
					Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden. <br>
					A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind. <br>
					Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy!  An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine. <br>
					This is the perfect place for a home away from home.

					We understand that pets are an important part of the family.
					We are pet friendly by arrangement - so please talk to us about your needs.
					We offer a fully enclosed backyard, shady trees, water bowls, food bowls and a lead if you forget one.
					Only 3 minutes from a leash free beach, an oval close by and if you want to sleep in we are happy to take your dog (depending on its size) for a walk in the morning.

				<p style="font-size: 23px;"> 
					"So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!" <br> <br>
					"This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing" <br> <br>
					"Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!" <br> <br>
					"Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt.  Thank you." <br> <br>
					"What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved it and will return again and again." <br> <br>
					"Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!" <br> <br>
					"A few minutesâ€™ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!" <br> <br>
					Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"
